                    <p class="bio-body">Welcome to my Github Pages website! I started programming a little over 12 years ago, I started out with C# and C++ I would bounce around between those two languages making little projects. I never really moved pass console applications 
                        with those languages. Then in 2012 I got my first Macbook Pro and that changed everything! I had always wanted to make iOS applications but had never had the resources to be able to
                    ie: a Mac. I don't think I slept at all the first week I had that Macbook Pro, I stayed awake 24/7 trying to learn Objective-C as well as the ins and outs of iOS Development.
                    As the years have gone by I have continued to develop iOS projects but I have also been interested like many others in developing web apps and apis. Over the past two years I have spent a lot of time learning Asp.Net Core(a little nostalgia from my earlier C# days) as well as Laravel.
                    All in all I just love to program, I think it is absolutly amazing to take an idea and in a sense bring it to life!
